Langevin model of membrane electroporation coded in Yorick

We find that curvature-driven growth of pores in electrically charged membranes correctly reproduces charge-pulse experiments. 
Our model, consisting of a Langevin equation for the time dependence of the pore radius coupled to an ordinary differential equation 
for the number of pores, captures the statistics of the pore population and its effect on the membrane conductance. The calculated pore 
radius is a linear, and not an exponential, function of time, as observed experimentally. Two other important features of charge-pulse 
experiments are recovered: pores reseal for low and high voltages but grow irreversibly for intermediate values of the voltage. Our set 
of coupled ordinary differential equations is equivalent to the partial differential equation used previously to study pore dynamics, but 
permits the study of longer timescales necessary for the simulations of voltage-clamp experiments. 
An effective phase diagram for such experiments is obtained.
